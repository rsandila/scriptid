02212003.01 - nn/learn does not report the learning error consistently
         between learn -l file and learn -t file. This is not really
         an error as -l reports the error before learning occured for
         speed reasons and -t after learning has occured. This will
         not be fixed.
02212003.02 - nn/learn reports grossly incorect NN Mflops per cycle.
02252003.01 - nn/learn can corrupt temp.nnw when stopped.
DONE
